        <h3>NOTES</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The "C" button allows you to clear all expressions from the calculator (you will be given a prompt to confirm).</li>
            <li>Negative numbers can be entered simply with the "-" button or key. Additionally, a "+" preceeding a number that is not indicative of addition automatically makes it a positive number.</li>
            <li>Both negative and positive indicators are cumulative. Ex. entering "+--+-++-63" will output as 63.</li>
            <li>Trigonometric and logarithmic operatings <em>require</em> parentheses to be valid; Ex. "sin(π/3)" is valid, but "sinπ/3" is not.</li>
        </ul>
