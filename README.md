# Better Calculator
Web extension that features a calculator straight from the web toolbar.

- Calculator includes basic arithmetic ( + - * / ) plus exponents, trigonometry, and logarithms.
- Calculator respects the order of operations (parentheses first, then exponents, then multiplication and division, and finally addition and subtration, all left to right). 
- The Better Calculator responds to both clickable buttons and keyboard commands.
- Many of the key commands are easily found, but some might not be. Click the "Help!" button if you are not sure.
